    <h1> BASIC PASTA </h1>
        <img src="BasicPasta.png" title="Basic Pasta" alt ="Basic Pasta"/>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul> 
        <li> Dried Pasta (Any works well) </li>
        <li> Water </li>
        <li> Salt </li>
        <li> Tomato Puree </li>
        <li> Cheese/Tuna (Both/Optional) </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Methods </h2>
        <ol>
        <li> Boil your pasta adding salt to the water for later on. </li>
        <li>  While pasta is cooking grate your cheese/drain your tuna. </li>
        <li> When the pasta is cooked add about half a tube of tomato puree, 
stirring well, to give you a passata consistency. Of course you can just 
use passata if you want, and drain the pasta instead. </li>
        <li> Then, add the tuna if using any, stirring it in well. Leave for a minute 
to heat up the tuna. Add salt/pepper to taste. </li>
        <li> Serve into a bowl and sprinkle lots of cheese on top. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> This can be enjoyed as a simple tomato pasta, or with cheese or tuna, or 
both. </p>

<title> Omelette Recipe </title>
    <body>
    <h1> OMELETTE </h1>
        <img src = "Omelette.png" title = "Omelette" alt ="omelette"/>
        <h2> Ingredients </h2>
        <ul>
        <li> 3 Eggs </li>
        <li> Salt and Pepper </li>
        <li> Butter </li>
        <li> Grated Cheese (Optional) </li>
        <li> Mixed Herbs (Optional) </li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Methods </h2>
        <ol>
        <li> Mix the eggs in any sort of bowl or jug you like (a pint glass works well!) with salt, pepper and herbs if desired. </li>
        <li> Heat the butter (or oil) in a reasonably large frying pan. </li>
        <li> Pour in the egg mixture slowly and swirl the pan a little to even it out. </li>
        <li> After 30 seconds or so the top should firm up, at this point add grated cheese if you like. </li>
        <li> Continue cooking a little until the cheese begins to melt, then fold the omelette in half with a bendy spatula. </li>           
        <li> If its nice and cooked on the bottom already then serve, otherwise, continue cooking on each side a little more. </li>
        </ol> 
        <p> Sometimes I make an omelette with loads of onions, chopped sausages and vegetables in. If you do this then you probably won't be able to fold it so instead, pop the pan under a grill to finish the top off after its cooked underneath! </p>
