    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
    <li> 500g of cheap beef pieces (Stewing steak usually is cheap) </li>

    <li> 4 large onions </li>
    <li> 2 fat cloves of garlic </li>
    <li> Tbsp of plain flour </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Methods </h2>
    <ol>
    <li> Raw beef, roll it in the flour. Fry 4‚Äê5 pieces at a time in a hot saucepan to 
seal. Put to one side when all done. </li>
    <li> Cut the onions into quarters. Fry in the same frying pan as the beef to soak up the juices. </li>
    <li> Towards the end of frying the onion (They should be nicely brown round the egdes) throw in the smashed up cloves of garlic. </li>
    <li> Transfer the beef, onions, garlic to a deep casserole dish. Stir in the remaining 
flour. </li>
    <li> Pour on the bottle of beer. (It isn't going to be wasted!) </li>
    <li> Cover and cook at 150 for about 2 and a half hours. It will be gorgeous when it comes out. Serve with smash. </li>
